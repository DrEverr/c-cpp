# C++20 Algorithms

This repository contains example algorithms that demonstrate the use of the newest features in C++20.

## Features

- Concepts
- Ranges
- Coroutines
- Calendar and Time Zone Library
- Improved constexpr
- Modules
- Three-way Comparison (Spaceship Operator)

## Getting Started

To compile and run the examples, you will need a C++20 compatible compiler such as GCC 10+, Clang 10+, or MSVC 2019.

### Compiling

```sh
g++ -std=c++20 -o ascii ascii.cpp
```

### Running

```sh
./ascii
```

## Examples

- **Concepts**: Demonstrates the use of concepts to specify template requirements.
- **Ranges**: Shows how to use the new ranges library for more expressive and readable code.
- **Coroutines**: Example of asynchronous programming using coroutines.
- **Calendar and Time Zone**: Utilizes the new calendar and time zone library for date and time manipulation.
- **Constexpr**: Improved constexpr capabilities for compile-time computation.
- **Modules**: Example of modular programming in C++20.
- **Three-way Comparison**: Demonstrates the use of the spaceship operator for comparisons.
